On Heroku - [cwss.herokuapp.com](cwss.herokuapp.com)
*Please note: this is currently on the freebie Heroku plan, which sleeps after 30 mins inactivity, if sleeping it can take 15 sec to spin up!*

Gotchas:
- Antivirus will break hot reload
- Webstorm 2016 needs the option unchecked "use safe write" for hot reload to work
